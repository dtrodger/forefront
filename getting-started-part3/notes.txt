Pull the image we uploaded in step 2 from the registry.

Run 5 instances of that image as a service called web, limiting each one to use, at most, 10% of the CPU (across all cores), and 50MB of RAM.

Immediately restart containers if one fails.

Map port 4000 on the host to web’s port 80.

Instruct web’s containers to share port 80 via a load-balanced network called webnet. (Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 80 at an ephemeral port.)

Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).
